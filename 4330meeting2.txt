Meeting Summary: 10/18/16 - 7:00 - 9:00 PM
Working on the SRS document as a group in the study room at The Exchange.
Decided to go with a pin login rather than a username and password system. If the user forgets their pin we will add a security
question feature in order to keep the users information secure.
Database for software interface?
Drew out what the different screens of the app could look like.
